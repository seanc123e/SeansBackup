<all> applies enclosed CSS rule statements to all devices (the default).
<screen> applies rules only to devices with screens.
<print> applies rules only when printed.

<display-mode>: fullscreen to see if the page is currently in fullscreen mode.
<orientation>: <portrait|landscape> to see if the page is currently in portrait or landscape orientation. This can be used for mobile devices, but is often less reliable than width and height features.
<resolution> to see what the the pixel density is of the device to load higher resolution images for “high dpi” devices, such as the “retina” iPhone display.
<min-width>, <max-width>, <min-height>, <max-height> to see what the current document dimensions are. This is probably the most common type of query used in responsive layout.

/* Extra small devices (phones, less than 768px) */
/* No media query since this is the default in Bootstrap */

/* Small devices (tablets, 768px and up) */
@media (min-width: 768px) { ... }

/* Medium devices (desktops, 992px and up) */
@media (min-width: 992px) { ... }

/* Large devices (large desktops, 1200px and up) */
@media (min-width: 1200px) { ... }
