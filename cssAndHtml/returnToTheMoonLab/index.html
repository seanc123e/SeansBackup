            <h4>Learn More About NASA's Plan To Put The First Woman On The Moon</h4>
            <p>
                With the <strong>Artemis</strong> program, NASA will land the <strong>first woman on the Moon by 2024</strong>, using innovative technologies to explore more of the lunar surface than ever before. This program is a collaboration between NASA, commercial, and international partners and will establish sustainable exploration by the end of the decade. Then, NASA will use what they learn on and around the <strong>Moon</strong> to take the next giant leap - sending astronauts to <strong>Mars</strong>.     
            </p>
            <h3>Artemis I</h3>

            <p>
                Artemis I will be the first integrated test of NASA's deep space exploration systems: the <strong>Orion</strong> spacecraft, <strong>Space Launch System (SLS)</strong> rocket and the ground systems at Kennedy Space Center. The first in a series of increasingly complex missions, Artemis I will be an uncrewed flight test that will provide a foundation for human deep space exploration, and demonstrate our commitment and capability to extend human existence to the Moon and beyond.
            </p>
            <p>
                “This is a mission that truly will do what hasn't been done and learn what isn't known,” said Mike Sarafin, Artemis I mission manager at NASA Headquarters in Washington. “It will blaze a trail that people will follow on the next Orion flight, pushing the edges of the envelope to prepare for that mission.”

                <p>
                    During this flight, the spacecraft will launch on the most powerful rocket in the world and fly farther than any spacecraft built for humans has ever flown. It will travel 280,000 miles from Earth, thousands of miles beyond the Moon over the course of about a three-week mission. Orion will stay in space longer than any ship for astronauts has done without docking to a space station and return home faster and hotter than ever before.

            <h3>Orion</h3>
            <p>
                For the first time in a generation, NASA is building a human spacecraft for deep-space missions that will usher in a new era of space exploration. Named after one of the largest constellations in the night sky and drawing from more than 50 years of spaceflight research and development, the Orion spacecraft is designed to explore the cosmos and unlock the mysteries of space.
            </p>

            <p>
                Not only will NASA be putting the first woman on the moon, the spacecraft development is being led by Catherine Koerner. She is responsible for the development and operations of NASA's newest spacecraft that will carry astronauts to the Moon and return them safely to Earth.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the Orion program manager, Koerner will be responsible for oversight of design, development and testing of the Orion spacecraft, as well as spacecraft manufacturing already under way at locations across the country and in Europe for ESA (European Space Agency).
            </p>

            <h3>Why Go to the Moon?</h3>

                <li>Establish American leadership and a strategic presence on the Moon while expanding our U.S. global economic impact</li>
                <li>Broaden our commercial and international partnerships</li>
                <li>Inspire a new generation and encourage careers in STEM</li> 
            </ol>

            <h3>Space Launch System</h3>
            <img src="https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/ShZQB3lJSvK11tR3GpWj" class="right-picture" width="200">
            <p>
                NASA's Space Launch System, or SLS, is a super-heavy-lift launch vehicle that provides the foundation for human exploration beyond Earth's orbit. With its unprecedented power and capabilities, SLS is the only rocket that can send Orion, astronauts, and cargo to the Moon on a single mission.
              </p>
              <p>
                Offering more payload mass, volume capability, and energy, SLS is designed to be flexible and evolvable and will open new possibilities for payloads, including robotic scientific missions to places like the Moon, Mars, Saturn, and Jupiter.
